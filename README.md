<h2>Reserve Page</h2>
In this page google api is used to show the map, put corresponding markers on all parking locations,<br>
generate search autofill and request your location to find nearby parking locations.<br><br>
Clicking on the "find parking near me" button asks for permission to use your location<br>
and fills the location list beneath if there are nearby parking lots.<br>
Using the search bar also fills the list depending on the search result.<br>
Clicking on the map markers pops up a info menu with details about the clicked location.<br>

<h2>Confirming Reservation</h2>
This page can be used as a logged user and as a non-logged user.<br><br>
If a logged user makes a reservation, their info is autofilled and the reservation gets stored in their reservation history,<br>
but if a non-logged user makes a reservation they can't access the reservation history page and need to manually fill out their information.<br><br>
The payment info is not required.<br>
For the date and time selection i use the daterangepicker library.<br>
